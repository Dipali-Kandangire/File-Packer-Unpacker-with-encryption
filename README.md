# File-Packer-Unpacker-with-encryption

This title reflects the key features of the project:

->File Packing and Unpacking (storing multiple files in a single file).

->Metadata Handling (storing file names and sizes).

->Security Features (encryption and decryption techniques for file data).

This demonstrates how the project efficiently packs multiple files into one and then unpacks them while preserving both metadata (file names and sizes) and content.
